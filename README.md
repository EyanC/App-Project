GA Second App Project

>**Problem:** 
In the beginning I had trouble making all of my links work together. They worked individually, but not linked. Thanks to Johnny for walking me through what was wrong and explaining how to correct the errors in the code. 

I have been frustrated with Bootstrap, and decided to do the majority of my styling in CSS, but I am getting more used to the way the bootstrap code works in the HTML files. 

I also had trouble not getting my CSS to work on all of my html files, until I noticed that I forgot to link the style page (Hand-On-Face), and then everything started to work. It was like the sun coming out from behind the clouds. (lol).
